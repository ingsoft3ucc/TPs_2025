# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an educational repository for "Ingeniería del Software 3" course at UCC (Universidad Católica de Córdoba), focused on practical assignments covering modern software engineering practices. The repository contains course materials and practical assignments (trabajos prácticos) in Spanish.

## Repository Structure

- `/trabajos/` - Contains all practical assignments (TPs) and supporting materials
  - Each TP is numbered (01-09) with corresponding markdown files, PowerPoint presentations, and PDFs
  - Topics covered include Git, Docker, Azure DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, unit testing, integration testing, and containerization

## Key Information

### Course Topics
1. Git basics
2. Docker introduction
3. Azure DevOps
4. Build pipelines (Azure DevOps)
5. Release pipelines (Azure DevOps)
6. Unit testing
7. Code coverage and integration testing
8. Container deployment in Azure with Azure CLI
9. Advanced container deployment in Azure

### Assignment Requirements
- Each practical assignment (TP) has a 2-week delivery deadline
- Students must submit work via their own Git repositories
- Final grade is based on the average of all TPs (no traditional exams)

### Final Integrative Project Requirements
The final project must include:
- A complete application with frontend, backend, and database
- Automated build and deploy using Azure DevOps Pipelines or GitHub Actions
- Unit and integration tests with visible reports
- QA and Production environments with manual approval for production deployment
- Automated deployment triggered by pull requests to master branch

## Development Notes

Since this is an educational repository containing course materials rather than a software project, there are no build, test, or deployment commands. The repository serves as a central location for course documentation and practical assignments.

When working with this repository:
- All materials are in Spanish
- Focus on maintaining clear, educational content
- Preserve the existing numbering system for assignments
- Keep PowerPoint, PDF, and markdown versions synchronized when making updates
